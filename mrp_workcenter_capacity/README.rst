Work Center Capacity
====================


The theoretical Production Work Center Capacity is calculated as follows:

* number of resources available - standard Odoo field
* efficienty factor - standard Odoo field
* working days per week
* working hours per days
* number of shifts per day


This is reported into workorders for information purposes.



The theoretical Production Work Center Capacity is used to consolidate "Master Production Plan" performing "Rough Capacity Check".
